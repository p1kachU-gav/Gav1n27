T H E SCHOOL 
HISTORY OF INFANT JESUS ACADEMY 
The Infant Jesus Academy (IJA) School System was established 
in response to a need for a co-educational school that offers excellent 
education to students of families of average means. It started as a small 
school in Marikina City offering classes for pre-school children and has 
expanded into a 3-campus school system that offers complete courses 
in basic education, including senior high school. 
THE MARIKINA CAMPUS 
In the late 1970’s, Mrs. Consolacion Florentino-Mallonga, 
together with her husband, Dr. Alberto T. Mallonga, established a school 
in Rancho Estate Subdivision, part of the growing suburbs of Marikina. 
Mrs. Mallonga was a respected educator in the community with more 
than 30 years of experience in teaching and administration while Dr. 
Mallonga was a physician who decided to retire from medical practice 
to concentrate on helping his wife with her new endeavor. The school 
that they established was envisioned as an alternative for families who 
could not afford to send their children to exclusive schools that were 
known to offer quality education but who desire a comparable, 
excellent schooling for them. In addition, the founders also wanted to 
inculcate in the students positive values that will help them become 
effective citizens of the country. Of particular interest to the founders of 
the school is the spiritual formation of the students in the Catholic faith, 
an objective that they pursued without prejudice to the admission of 
students who have different religious affiliations. The plan to put up this 
school was conceived in December, the Christmas Season of 1978, thus 
its name, Infant Jesus Academy, to honor the Holy Infant in the Manger. 
The IJA Marikina Campus has been steadily growing through the years, 
with its mother campus extending to two sub-campuses within its vicinity 
to accommodate students’ need for wider and better facilities. 
The Main Campus 
The main campus, IJA-Marikina, is located in the residential 
community of Rancho Estate, bounded by SSS Village in Marikina City. 
Formal school operations began in June 1979 with the opening of 
classes for 127 Pre-elementary pupils. The corporate entity responsible for  
the management of the school system, Infant Jesus Academy Inc., was 
formally organized and registered as a non-stock, non-profit corporation 
in February 1980. The following academic year, classes for Grades 1-4 
started and the first batch of Grade 6 pupils graduated in March 1983. 
Government recognition for the Elementary Course was granted in the 
same year. 
Many parents requested the school to organize a High School 
Department, and so in June 1983 the IJA High School started its 
operations, with the government recognition granted in 1986. The first 
batch of High School graduates received their diplomas in 1987. 
The active involvement of the parents in the development of 
Infant Jesus Academy was evident since the school’s beginnings with 
the IJA Family Council (IJAFC), the association of parents, teachers and 
guardians of the IJA students, formally organized in 1980. Since then, the 
IJAFC had been a steadfast partner of the school administration in 
improving the school’s facilities and programs. 
The early 1990’s witnessed a rush of construction to improve the 
school’s instructional facilities in this campus. Its three-storey building that 
currently houses the classrooms and offices was completed in 1993. 
More land was acquired by the school in 1995 which enabled the 
administration to build the area which is now occupied by the 
computer laboratory, the HE laboratory and canteen. A four-storey 
structure which houses among others, the school chapel was 
renovated in 1999. To mark the school’s Silver Jubilee in 2004, its 
quadrangle was renovated and called the Jubilee Quadrangle. In 2006, 
its science laboratory was improved to enhance the Science 
instructional program. When the school celebrated its Pearl Anniversary 
in 2009, the school façade in the main campus was renovated to mark 
this event. 
The Molave (CFM) Campus  
The year 2001 witnessed the opening of a separate Pre
elementary campus along Gen. Ordonez St., in Marikina Heights which 
was called the IJA-Molave campus (because Gen. Ordonez St. was 
originally called Molave St.). The attractive classrooms and play areas 
provide a stimulating learning environment for children. 
Between 2007 and 2008, the school was able to expand the IJA-Molave campus, and the decision to put up a Primary Level campus 
was made in 2009. In December of that year, the construction of the 
new IJA Primary building was started. The building was completed in 
October 2010 and was named Consolacion F. Mallonga Memorial 
(CFMM) Building to honor the memory of the IJA founder and Directress 
who passed on September 17, 2010. In November 2010, after the 
semestral break, the primary pupils started enjoying their newly 
constructed building, with classrooms equipped with television sets for 
the teachers’ technology integration and with built-in comfort rooms for 
primary boys’ and girls’ usage. 
The Ipil (ATM) Campus 
IJA was able to acquire another property close to the Molave 
Campus, along Ipil Street in Marikina Heights in December 2015. This 
move is in line with its commitment to continuously improve its facilities for 
existing and future students. This campus is intended to house the upper 
classmen of the High School and two levels of the Senior High School. 
This property has two existing buildings, which accommodate 
classrooms and laboratory facilities. In the early days of 2016, renovations 
of the two buildings started, and in July 2016 the first three classes of 
Grade 11 students moved in its building at the back (now called Building 
B) while continuous renovations were being done in the front building 
(now called Building A). In June 2017, the campus was able to provide 
homerooms and facilities for the Grade 10, 11 and 12 students. Building 
A now houses, among others, the cafeteria, Physical and Biological 
Science Laboratories, Computer Laboratory and Library while Building B 
houses the faculty room and the home rooms of the students. This 
campus is called the ATM campus in honor of the other founder of the 
school, the late husband of Mrs. Consolacion F. Mallonga, Dr. Alberto T. 
Mallonga (ATM).  
To provide for the students’ increasing need for facilities, in 2017, 
the school acquired the property owned by the former Celestial Village 
Academy, which has ceased operations. It is a property adjacent to the 
ATM Building hence the name ATM Extension Building. Beginning School 
Year 2018-2019, it accommodated the grades 9 and 10 students. The 
acquisition of the ATM extension made room for the provision of an 
exhibition hall for visual arts (the Sentro Leona Art Center) and the faculty 
room in Building A and a multi-purpose hall at the third floor of Building B, 
as the cafeteria from the Building A was transferred to the extension 
building. 
The school’s founder, Mrs. Consolacion F. Mallonga was formerly 
a nun belonging to the Servants of the Holy Spirit congregation and so 
Catholic education was promoted in the school since its inception. 
Infant Jesus Academy was accepted as a member of the Catholic 
Education Association of the Philippines (CEAP) in 2006. In the same 
year, it underwent a certification program conducted by the Private 
Education Assistance Committee (PEAC) of the Department of 
Education (DepEd) thru its Fund for Assistance to Private Education 
(FAPE), which enable the school to secure tuition subsidy for its high 
school students under the Education Service Contracting (ESC) of the 
8   
Government Assistance to Students and Teachers in Private Education 
(GASTPE) program of the government. The school’s participation in this 
program provided a much needed financial assistance to many 
students.  
While continuously improving its facilities and services, the IJA 
system of schools always set as its utmost priority, the continuous 
development of its instructional programs by seeking accreditation from 
reputable accrediting organizations. In February 2005, the High School 
Department of IJA-Marikina was granted applicant status by the 
Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities 
(PAASCU), making it the first co-educational school in Marikina to 
receive such a status. In 2008, it became an accredited member school 
with a Level I status. Its Elementary or Grade School Department 
underwent the consultancy visit and the preliminary survey in 2009 and 
2010, respectively, and was granted applicant status in 2011. The year 
2012 marked another milestone for IJA as its High School Department 
received its Level II accredited status from the PAASCU, valid for five 
years, while its Grade School Department got the endorsement for 
formal visit from the same accrediting association. Consequently, in 
2013, the Grade School was given a Level I accreditation. IJA has 
relentlessly embraced its mission of advancing its programs and services 
by seeking consultancy and training from experts in education, both 
within the country and abroad. In 2016, IJA invited a team of consultants 
from the United States to train its teachers and personnel on the current 
trends in the teaching-learning process for 21stcentury learners. In the 
same year, IJA requested the PAASCU to revisit its Grade School which 
resulted in the Grade School being granted Level II Accredited Status 
with a five-year validity period. In December of 2017, the High School 
Department was awarded its Level II Re-Accredited Status, valid until 
November 2022. 
As IJA’s curricular programs steadily progress and as its status of 
being accredited gradually spreads, several foreign students started to 
express intent of enrolling and several even enrolled. Thus the school 
sought and was granted accreditation with the Bureau of Immigration in 
December 2018 for it to be authorized to admit foreign students and/or 
students born of Filipino parents abroad.

THE ANTIPOLO CAMPUS 
In December 1995, a new campus with an area of close to one 
hectare was built to serve the needs of students residing in Cogeo and 
the nearby areas in Antipolo City. In June of the following year, classes 
opened for 27 pupils from Grades 1-3. They were enrolled in classes that 
were considered extension for the Marikina campus. In June 1997, IJA
Antipolo formally operated as a separate campus. In the year 2000 it 
was granted government recognition for courses in the Pre-elementary 
and Elementary levels and in 2003 the Secondary level course was 
granted government recognition. The original building was expanded in 
1999 to accommodate the growing school population and to provide 
more facilities for the students. 
In 1997, the IJA Antipolo Family Council was organized. The 
IJAAFC had been a supportive presence in all the activities and 
programs of the school, conducting numerous fund-raising and training 
activities among the member parents. 
In 2006, this campus was certified by PEAC to be an ESC 
participating school, making it facilitate tuition subsidy grants from the 
government for its high school students. The desire to continuously 
improve the quality of the school’s educational services provided the 
impetus to seek accreditation from PAASCU for IJA-Antipolo. In October 
15 – 16, 2015, the school underwent preliminary accreditation visit and 
was granted an applicant status in December of the same year. In 2016, 
the school worked on its Level I accreditation and was granted such 
status in the same year, valid for three years.  
The improvement of the physical plant of the school is 
continuous. The construction of a covered court in June 2016 provided 
the much needed area for assemblies, programs and Physical 
10   
Education classes. Plans are also underway for the construction of 
additional classrooms and other facilities. 
THE KALIBO CAMPUS 
The school continued to grow with the establishment of IJA
Kalibo in 2003. Classes for about 35 Pre-elementary children were 
conducted in a rented building across the town plaza of Kalibo, Aklan. 
In December of the same year, negotiations for the acquisition of a half
hectare property were completed and the new IJA-Kalibo campus was 
built. The main building which houses classrooms and other academic 
facilities like the library and laboratories was named Dr. Alberto T. 
Mallonga Hall in honor of the school’s founding president. The school 
was granted government recognition in 2006 for complete courses in 
the pre-elementary, elementary and secondary levels. In the same year, 
this campus was certified by PEAC as an ESC participating school and in 
2009, it became a member of CEAP. The school has been serving as the 
testing center of the Ateneo de Manila University for its Ateneo College 
Entrance Test (ACET) since 2008. Likewise, the University of Santo Tomas 
(UST) has also established linkages with the school starting 2011 for its 
college admission test. IJA-Kalibo now serves as testing center in Aklan 
for the University of Santo Tomas Entrance Test (USTET). 
As in the case of the other IJA schools, the IJA Kalibo Family 
Council was immediately organized upon the school’s establishment in 
2003. The IJAKFC is actively engaged in activities and programs that 
benefit the entire IJA community. 
In 2011, a new building was constructed in the campus to 
address its growing population’s needs. This building bears the name of 
the beloved directress and founder of the IJA School System, Mrs. 
Consolacion F. Mallonga. 
  11 
The years 2017 to 2019 marked important years in the IJA Kalibo 
history as it prepared for its accreditation from PAASCU. On its 15th year 
of service to the Kalibo community in 2018, it received the approval from 
PAASCU to proceed with its formal survey visit. Subsequently, in May 
2019, it was awarded accreditation (Level I), making it the first Basic 
Educational institution in Aklan to be granted accredited status. 
SYSTEM-WIDE CONTINUOUS DEVELOPMENT 
Today, the Infant Jesus Academy schools are recognized in the 
communities where they are located to be among the best 
educational institutions offering quality education. A distinct character of 
the IJA schools is their commitment to integrity, responsibility, excellence 
and discipline - values which serve as the foundation of all its policies 
and programs. A corps of dedicated and effective administrators is at 
the helm of the school’s operations. Forming the backbone are faculty 
members who are honed in the craft of molding young children into 
becoming effective life-long learners and responsible citizens. The IJA 
Faculty undergo yearly in-service training and benefit from the 
occasional lectures/demonstrations conducted by highly respected 
educators from local academic institutions and also educators from 
abroad. The administrators and faculty members are supported in their 
tasks by other school personnel who attend to the many needs of the 
learning community. 
Developments in information and communication technology 
had a positive impact in teaching and learning as well as administration 
at IJA. In 2006, the Marikina campus was able to automate the process 
of enrollment and issuing grades and other academic reports through 
the School Integrated Management System (SIMS) software that the 
12   
school commissioned to be developed. The same was done for 
administration tasks like cashiering and payroll preparations. The SIMS 
was adopted for use by the Antipolo campus in 2010. In all of its 
campuses, IJA teachers, students, administrators and the school staff are 
provided efficient access to the internet through broadband 
connections. Another milestone in the history of the school is the 
intensification of educational technology integration in instruction 
through the adoption of a learning management system and more 
extensive use of effective audio visual materials. All the classrooms of the 
three schools are equipped with big television screens, and the teachers 
extensively prepare and use audio visual materials in instruction using 
their laptops and other devices.  
The impacts of the on-going educational reforms in the country 
have also affected the school system. The past years have witnessed 
the continuous review and revision of the school’s curriculum to address 
the needs of 21st century learners and in preparation for the 
implementation of the Senior High School program. IJA strives to make 
the teaching-learning process more balanced, well-rounded and 
student-centered as it adopted several educational frameworks that 
help teachers prepare and facilitate lessons that would develop the 
students’ socio-emotional skills alongside their intellectual competencies. 
Together with that, the school also strengthened its advocacy for 
Positive Discipline as it continuously trains its personnel in the field of 
Positive Discipline for Everyday Teaching and Parenting. From 2015 to 
2017, three of its administrators have been trained by the Save the 
Children Organization to be official facilitators of teacher trainings for 
Positive Discipline. Within those years, the school became the first private 
school to be model of positive discipline in the National Capital Region 
and continues to be one up until these present days.  
In 2016, all the campuses of the school system opened its Senior 
  13 
High School, offering the academic track with all the strands: Science, 
Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM); Humanities and 
Social Sciences (HUMSS); Accounting, Business and Management 
(ABM); and General Academic Strand (GAS). The first batch of students 
in the Senior High School program graduated in March of 2018. 
In addition to the government-led educational reforms, another 
development that has created a felt impact on the IJA school system is 
the adoption by the CEAP of the Philippine Catholic Schools Standards 
(PCSS). In May of 2016, representatives of administrators, faculty 
members, staff, students, parents and alumni from the different 
campuses of IJA gathered to review the school’s vision and mission 
statements to determine adherence to the standards and benchmarks 
of PCSS. The vision and mission statements of the school were 
consequently revised. In addition, the school system’s five-year 
development plan for 2015-2020 was crafted using the PCSS as one of 
the references in setting goals and objectives.  
In more than four decades of promoting excellence, Infant 
Jesus Academy continuously seeks to improve its programs and facilities 
to be able to provide quality education and character formation for the 
students. The firm commitment of the members of the school 
community to pursue the school’s vision and mission provides the 
impetus for continued growth and development in the future years to 
come.  
14   
Promoting faith-enhanced quality education for 21st century learning  
Vision 
Infant Jesus Academy is an inclusive learning community inspired by a 
living faith in Christ as it nurtures learners to be God-loving patriotic 
Filipinos, imbued with the values of integrity, responsibility, excellence, 
and discipline.  
Mission 
We, the members of the Infant Jesus Academy community, promote life-long learning aimed at the holistic development of the human person - 
mind, body and spirit. We pursue a curriculum which fosters a culture of 
excellence through 21st century learning, strengthened by a desire to 
live our Christian faith and value our cultural heritage. 
We draw inspiration from the Infant Jesus in the Manger as we 
look forward with our people to a society where peace arising from 
justice reigns, where man takes responsibility for the wise stewardship of 
God’s creations, where Filipinos take pride and dignity in our national 
identity. He fills us with hope that by working towards the fulfillment of 
our vision, we shall be able to do our share in the realization of this 
dream.  
We endeavor to develop and strengthen the students’ faith 
and love in God, helping them to see themselves as members of a 
Christian community.  
We desire to instill in the students love for our country and 
cultivate their being Filipino in a global community of nations.  
We want them to be aware of humanity’s responsibility towards 
the conservation of the earth’s resources and the preservation of the 
environment. 
  15 
We take every effort to prepare our students for tertiary 
education in the best universities and colleges. We believe that these 
institutions have the capability to develop the students’ abilities to their 
full potential, at the same time, strengthen in them the values that 
would propel them to take an active role in transforming the global 
society.  
We strive to develop in them a sense of integrity and self
discipline so that they are constantly guided by these words they have 
learned throughout their stay in IJA: “ Do the right thing, at the right time, 
in the right place with the right people.”  
We aspire to develop their sense of responsibility, helping them 
become aware of their rights, duties and obligations and fulfill these in 
whatever situation they find themselves in. 
We aim for the holistic development of the individual – 
physically fit, emotionally adjusted, academically outstanding, socially 
responsive, appreciative of the arts, and vocationally proficient. 
These, we hope to achieve in a learning process and 
environment that foster communication and collaboration, develop 
critical thinking and problem-solving skills, and promote effective and 
ethical use of information, media and technological resources.
 With our particular concern for children of working parents, we 
are committed to pursuing measures that will promote cooperation 
between the school and home in ensuring close attention to the 
personal welfare of the students. 
Lastly, in view of the present Philippine reality where quality 
education is accessible only to those belonging to the upper classes, we 
commit ourselves to helping children of average means obtain 
excellent education and will ensure educational and financial policies 
that will fulfill this commitment. 
16   
THE IJA EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES 
We desire to continuously strengthen the Christian faith and 
emotional maturity of the members of the IJA Community as we 
facilitate learning that will help them acquire practical, analytical and 
creative skills that will enable them to adapt to the needs of the 
changing times. Specifically we aim to: 
1. help them develop a strong and abiding faith in God and be 
guided by sound Christian values; 
2. enable them to see in their neighbors their counterparts as 
children of God, thus providing the basis for social awareness 
and involvement in a global community; 
3. awaken in them love for country and pride in being Filipino; 
4. develop in the students competence in oral and written 
communication in Filipino and English as well as mastery of core 
content in Social Studies, Mathematics, Science and other 
academic subjects that will enable them to cope with the 
demands of tertiary education in the best colleges and 
universities; 
5. facilitate the students’ acquisition of technology and life and 
career skills that will help them become effective learners and 
responsible citizens; 
6. train them to make appropriate personal economic choices 
and use entrepreneurial skills to enhance productivity;

THE IJA SEAL 
The IJA school seal features an escutcheon divided into four 
parts by a cross which symbolizes Jesus Christ who is the center of all the 
school’s undertakings. On the upper left is the image of the Holy Spirit, 
representing the source of inspiration of the school’s Founder, Mrs. 
Consolacion F. Mallonga who used to belong to the Servant Sisters of 
the Holy Spirit congregation. The image of the Holy Spirit also symbolizes 
that the members of the school community continuously seek guidance 
from Him in achieving the school’s vision and mission. The torch and 
  35 
open book represent enlightenment and 
knowledge. At the lower right is the image of Infant 
Jesus in the Manger, the guiding light when the 
school was being constructed in December 1978. 
Two parts of the heraldic shield bear the school 
colors—blue and silver. Blue is associated with the 
Virgin Mary, peace and service. Silver symbolizes 
the enduring light that continuously sparks the 
school’s commitment to excellence and pursuit of 
relevant education for the youth. The 1979 on the 
curved edge of the escutcheon was the year 
when the first IJA School - IJA Marikina, opened its 
doors to students. The scroll below the escutcheon 
indicates the location of the campus and the year when it was 
established. 
The seal of Infant Jesus 
Academy serves as a 
constant reminder of 
what IJA stands for. 
THE IJA CORE VALUES 
At Infant Jesus Academy, the four core values that best define 
our community are Integrity, Responsibility, Excellence and Discipline 
(IRED). These values are the very foundation of all the school’s 
undertakings, and therefore the rules and regulations that students 
should follow will have to be based on these. It is an IJAian’s task to 
follow school rules and to trust that these are designed to strengthen in 
them the values that would propel them to take an active role in 
transforming the global society. 
Integrity 
The consistent strength to adhere to a code of moral reasoning 
in spite of the personal discomfort this might bring. IJAians must 
show moral strength and consistency in matters personal, 
academic, social, and athletic. 
Responsibility 
The quality of being morally or legally accountable, reliable and 
worthy of trust. We must hold no one but ourselves responsible for 
our own actions or inactions, as we know we are free to choose 
them. 
36   
Excellence 
The expectation that all will learn, and strive to learn to the best 
of their abilities with barriers to learning recognized and addressed, 
opportunities to extend academic ability being provided along 
with creativity and individuality being nurtured. 
Discipline 
There is time for everything: a time for rising in the early morning, 
a time for prayer, a time for work, a time for a little rest and 
nourishment needed by the body, a time for silence, a time for 
relaxing. In a society of pleasure-seeking, of instant gratification of 
needs, an IJAian is trained to observe discipline in everything: 
academic discipline of doing the assigned tasks, the discipline of 
orderliness, the discipline of listening and other things. These many 
little details in the school life of the students are meant to help them 
grow to be responsible, well-rounded members of society.

INSTRUCTIONAL POLICIES AND REGULATIONS 
THE IJA CURRICULAR PROGRAM 
As a college preparatory academic institution, Infant Jesus 
Academy offers a learning continuum that is designed to prepare the 
learner for college work in the leading colleges and universities. The 
curriculum is implemented through the:  
1. Pre-School which covers Nursery to Kindergarten 
2. Primary School which covers Grade 1 to Grade 3 
3. Middle School which covers Grade 4 to Grade 8 
4. High School which covers the upper classmen of the Junior High 
School (Grade 9 and Grade 10) and Senior High School (Grade 
11 and Grade 12) 
Aside from the curricular offerings in the different learning areas, 
the program also includes co-curricular as well as extra-curricular 
activities. 
The Curricular Learning Areas  
Communication Arts in English. This subject area is offered beginning 
Nursery and is taken up to Grade 12. It aims to develop competencies 
  45 
on both spoken and written English with focus on the five macro skills: 
viewing, listening, speaking, reading and writing. Auditory and visual 
discrimination and comprehension are the viewing and listening skills 
enhanced in this area, while pronunciation and use of expressions and 
grammatical structures are developed as part of the learners’ speaking 
skills. These skills are strengthened through the speech festivals (where 
both prepared and extemporaneous speeches are delivered by 
students) conducted by the school in support of the teachers’ 
customary classroom activities. Vocabulary development, word 
recognition, comprehension and study skills are part of the reading skills 
which the school develops by introducing classical and contemporary 
literary works of both local and foreign authors. Penmanship, which is 
introduced in the Pre-School Level and further enhanced in Grades 1 to 
6 forms part of writing skills of the learners in addition to the skills in 
composing essays and other literary or non-literary articles (composition 
writing). In the High School Level, enrichment courses related to 
Communication Arts in English are also offered.  
Communication Arts in Filipino. Filipino as a separate area is introduced 
in Kinder. Its primary aim is to develop competencies in using the Filipino 
language in various communicative situations. It also aims to inculcate in 
the learner a sense of pride in one’s cultural heritage and Filipino identity. 
The development of the 5 macro skills of viewing, listening, 
speaking, reading and writing in this subject emphasizes enhancement 
of the critical thinking skills and communicative or interactive 
competence. These specific knowledge and skills are developed by 
introducing the students to materials such as themes, poems, jingles, 
stories, and dialogues suited to their level. These are further enhanced 
through the Timpalak Bigkasan done quarterly to augment the 
teacher’s regular classroom activities. 
In addition, some contents from Araling Panlipunan in the 
Primary and in the Intermediate Levels are used to develop the 
language skills. 
Science and Technology. Science education aims to help learners gain 
functional understanding of science concepts and principles that will 
eventually prepare them to be conscientious individuals who make 
sound judgments and decisions about real life situations (social, health or 
46   
environmental) that require application of their scientific knowledge. It 
also aims to help the learners appreciate developments brought about 
by advances in technology as this is being considered part of everyday 
human affairs. 
The IJA Science Education, which is offered as early as Nursery 
all the way up to high school, exposes the learners to the specific 
processes like observing, inferring, predicting and experimenting. Basic 
concepts about one’s health and ideas about the environment and its 
conservation also form part of this curriculum. It is further enhanced in 
the higher levels with the integration of technology and its wise and 
ethical use. Through the IJA science curriculum, the learner’s are 
expected to manifest deeper understanding of concepts that would 
eventually lead them to apply their learning in appropriate contexts in 
real life.  
Mathematics. The study of mathematics is introduced as early as 
Nursery. The subject area specifically aims to develop the learners’ skills 
and/or processes of knowing and understanding, estimating, 
computing and solving, visualizing and modeling, representing and 
communicating, conjecturing, reasoning, proving and decision-making, 
and applying and connecting, which are necessary for their day-to-day 
dealing with activities and problems in real life. In IJA, these skills and 
processes are developed through classic classroom activities 
augmented by the use of manipulative objects, measuring devices, 
calculators, computers and other forms of technology. In general, the 
IJA Math curriculum contributes to the fulfillment of one of IJA’s goals of 
producing individuals who are critical thinkers and are equipped with 
problem solving skills that will make them cope with the challenges of 
the 21st century. 
Social Studies (Araling Panlipunan). This is concerned with the study of 
man and his relationship to society. This deals with civics, geography, 
history, government, economics and the development of civilization 
and culture of the Philippines, Asia and the World.  
In the Primary Level, this subject area develops competencies 
that are clustered around these three major values: national identity 
and self-esteem, national unity, and loyalty to the nation. In this area, the 
pupils engage in character-building activities, develop their good 
  47 
behavior, and are taught values like love of country, good citizenship, 
respect for one’s cultural heritage, and pagiging maka-Pilipino. In the 
Intermediate Level, Araling Panlipunan focuses on the following: the 
geographical features of the Philippines as part of Southeast Asia and 
the world, the culture, the history of the country from the prehistoric 
period down to our contemporary times, with some introduction about 
our democratic system of government and the rights, duties, and 
responsibilities of citizens in Philippine society. 
Araling Panlipunan in the High School Level is a learning area 
designed to develop moral, spiritual and social values and pride in one’s 
cultural heritage. The program aims to develop in the learners concern 
for the people and the government through regular discussion of social, 
political and moral issues, both in past and current; that are suited to the 
level of the students. The program also caters to the enhancement of 
the learners’ knowledge about the Philippines as part of Southeast Asia 
and the world – its history and culture. The approach to this subject is 
more proactive to enable the learners to respond to social and historical 
issues better than simply memorizing names, dates or places in history.  
Technology, Home Economics and Livelihood Education. This is a 
common learning area beginning in the Intermediate Level. It aims to 
develop desirable work attitudes, basic work skills and habits relevant to 
everyday chores at home, school and community. The subject area 
also provides practical work experiences with special emphasis on the 
use of technology that would develop awareness and interest in the 
occupational jobs.  
The Edukasyong Pantahanan at Pangkabuhayan (EPP) in the 
Intermediate Level focuses on the development of responsible home 
membership to strengthen the family. It also includes computer literacy 
program to address the needs of the students to keep pace with the 
fast changing technology of the current times. The Technology and 
Livelihood Education (TLE) in the High School Level covers phases of 
work in home economics, retail trade, computer education, and other 
livelihood and entrepreneurial skills designed to develop awareness of 
and interest in productive work. 
PE, Health, Music and Art. This Subject Area which is composed of 
different disciplines. The Physical Education component gives emphasis 
48   
on sports while providing activities to help the learner appreciate dance, 
rhythm, recreation and outdoor activities in the context of Philippine 
culture. At the same time, students are also introduced to the different 
aspects of Health Education such as personal and community health, 
health services, population education and others.  
Music deals with such elements as rhythm, harmony and 
melody and provides opportunities for the students to be exposed to 
and appreciate Asian and World music from the classical to the 
contemporary. Art develops the basic skills and sense of aesthetic 
perception, creative expression, and appreciation of our heritage as 
well as the natural and man-made environment.  
Edukasyon sa Pagpapahalaga (EP). The IJA EP program is composed of 
the following: Christian Living (CL)/Values Education (VE) and Revitalized 
Homeroom Guidance Program (RHGP). IJA integrates in its teachings 
and practices lessons in the Catholic faith and religious activities 
promoted by the Catholic Church. Its CL and VE Program facilitates the 
students’ learning of religious, spiritual and moral truths that complete 
their being Christ-centered individuals.  
The RHGP focuses on the strengthening of the learners’ 
character so that they may truly realize that though they are unique, 
they are not separate from their family and from the Christian 
community of which they are members. 
Co-Curricular and Extra-Curricular Activities 
Student Paper. The student publication of the school published once 
every semester is called The Blue Chronicle. This mainly consists of news 
and feature articles, editorial and literary works written by students in 
English and/or Filipino. It serves as venue for the development of 
journalistic interest and skills of the students.  
Student Government. The school provides its students with learning 
opportunities and first-hand experiences in leadership and exercising 
democratic procedures through the student government. In the 
Intermediate Level, their government is called Coordinating Body while

plunging necklines, shorts and mini-skirts are not allowed. 
Boys must sport neat-looking 
haircuts. Very long hair (the hair touching 
the collar, covering the ears and 
eyebrows) pony tails, dyed hair and other 
unusual haircuts are not allowed. The student may be required to get 
proper haircut if present cut is found undesirable. 
Girls are expected to keep their hair simple. Those with long hair 
are encouraged to tie them into a ponytail. Likewise, dyed hair and 
unusual hairdo are discouraged. 
The girls are discouraged from using nail polish, rouge, lipstick, or 
the like. They are discouraged from using jewelry except simple earrings 
and bracelets. Boys are not allowed to wear earrings, necklace or 
bangles. 
Students who have tattoos will not be allowed inside the school. 
Bringing of Unnecessary Items to School 
Students are not allowed to bring to school items such as toys, 
radios, camera, musical instruments, cell phones, music players and 
other expensive equipment unless these are to be used for some school 
activities.  
If needed, the student must secure a letter from his/her parent/
 guardian explaining the reason for bringing any of the aforementioned 
items and present the letter together with the item to the teacher 
concerned. 
Students are responsible for the items they bring to school. The 
school will not be held liable for any loss or damage to their belongings. 
Unnecessary items brought to school for the first time without a 
letter of explanation from the parents, will be confiscated and only the 
parents or guardians may claim them. If bringing of unnecessary items is 
repeated, items will be confiscated and parents or guardians may claim 
them only at the end of the academic year. 
80   
Leaving the School Campus During School Hours 
As a rule, students are not allowed to leave the school campus 
during school hours. Should there be a valid reason for the student to 
leave the campus, he/she (or the teacher in case of Pre-School to 
Grade 3 pupils) should: 
1. present to the Cluster Leader a letter from the parents, legal 
guardian or nurse giving a reason for leaving the campus; 
2. fill out the gate pass form (in duplicate) and submit to the 
Cluster Leader for approval and signature; and 
3. leave one of the forms with the Cluster Leader and present the 
other to the security guard.  
Suspension of Classes During Typhoons/Bad Weather 
Only the DepEd or the local government officials are authorized 
to cancel classes during typhoons or bad weather. Parents are advised 
to listen to the radio or watch TV for announcements regarding this 
matter. 
Classes may also be suspended by DepEd when there are 
floods or heavy rains. In the absence of any declaration from DepEd or 
other responsible government officials, the school leaves the 
attendance of the children to the discretion of the parents. 
Classes in the Pre-School Level are automatically suspended 
when storm signal no. 1 is raised by the PAGASA. When signal no. 2 is 
raised, classes from the Pre-School Level to the High School Level are 
automatically suspended. In the absence of storm signal warnings, we 
shall rely on the DepEd’s announcement of suspension.  
In cases of suspension due to inclement weather or other 
circumstances when students are already in school, students are 
dismissed 30 minutes after the announcement is made and with a 15
minute interval per level to ensure an organized flow of traffic for our 
students. In the Consolacion F. Mallonga Memorial Building, the Pre
School Level is dismissed first then followed by the Primary Level. Likewise, 
in the Main Campus, the Intermediate Level is dismissed first followed by 
the High School Level.  
In case of suspension of classes during quarterly examinations, 
  81 
the tests on the affected day/s will be moved automatically to the next 
class day/s, following the same sequence. For example: 
Monday 
Tuesday 
Wednesday

Likewise, we reiterate that parents have the ultimate 
responsibility to decide whether their children should go to school in 
case of bad weather. 
Parent-Teacher Conference 
Parents are encouraged to confer with teachers regarding their 
children’s performance and attitude in school. An appointment should 
be made beforehand so that the teacher concerned can arrange to 
see the parents during their vacant periods. The teacher may not see 
the parents during their classroom teaching periods or when doing other 
assigned tasks. 
Circular to Parents 
Circulars are issued to parents from time to time. These are to be 
presented by the students to their parents. The reply slips must be 
returned within two days after they have been distributed. 
Security Measures 
Only students and personnel are allowed to go to the classroom 
areas during school days. Visitors/parents are requested to limit 
themselves to the offices when they come to school for official 
transactions. (Department of Education Order under the Manual of 
Regulation for Private Schools, D.O. No. 88, s. 2010). Furthermore, all 
visitors must wear the Visitor’s Pass while inside the school campus. Any 
person with no official business with the school will not be allowed entry.  
Teachers and other school authorities are around to supervise 
82   
students 10 minutes before the morning assembly time. Therefore, 
parents are advised not to send their children to school too early 
because students may be left unattended and any untoward incident 
may occur. 
In the same manner, teachers will be around to supervise 
students within 10 minutes after dismissal time. Students who are not 
fetched from the school immediately or within the 10 minute period may 
be left unattended. 
For security purposes, we do not allow any student to leave the 
campus during dismissal time without an authorized person fetching 
him/her. Students whose parents allow them to commute (applicable 
for Grade 4 up to Grade 12) may apply for a Commuter’s Pass at the 
Principal’s Office. This pass is presented to the Guard who may allow 
them to go home after classes. 
Staying Beyond Class Hours 
No student is allowed to stay in the campus after class hours 
without a teacher or school authority to supervise their activities and 
without a written permission from their parents/guardians. In case they 
have some official/authorized activities beyond their dismissal time or 
during weekends, the teacher in-charge would send the Permit To Stay 
slip to the students for their parents to sign. This slip also signifies that the 
activity, though optional, is authorized by the school and it serves as their 
permit to enter the campus on weekends. The students are allowed to 
stay in the campus only up to 5:30 PM. 
Lost and Found Articles 
There are designated depository areas of all Lost and Found 
items in all campuses (usually near the Guard’s Corner). Lost items must 
be reported as soon as possible to the Cluster Leader concerned.  
Unclaimed items after the cut-off days of each quarter (last 
school day of the quarter) shall be forfeited in favor of the school and 
shall be donated to charity during its outreach activity. 
School supplies lying around unattended in the corridors, 
canteen, etc. shall be considered LOST AND FOUND and shall be 
collected by the school authorities (faculty, staff or SCB officers). These 
  83 
items shall be forfeited in favor of the school and shall be donated to 
charity anytime of the year. 
Solicitations, Contributions and Donations 
No solicitation, contribution or donation is allowed in the school 
without the approval of the Principal. All official business/financial 
transactions or payments must be done only in the Business Office. No 
other school personnel is allowed to receive or collect payments for any 
school requirements. Please call or see the principal in case of doubtful 
solicitations or financial transactions.  
Parties in School 
Parties to celebrate students’ birthdays and other occasions are 
not allowed inside the school. However, class parties during Christmas or 
Family Days may be held subject to approval of the Principal. 
Other School Policies 
Parents and other care-givers are discouraged from staying 
inside the campus to wait for their children/wards. 
In case parents/guardians need to be in school for some official 
business, they should come properly dressed. They should refrain from 
wearing shorts, plunging necklines, sleeveless tops, or slippers when they 
come to IJA. Furthermore, they should wear the Visitor’s Pass while inside 
the campus. 
Students should bring all their projects, books, PE uniforms, food 
and other things they need when they come to school. The school does 
not allow delivery of these items to the students. 
The students are not called out of the classrooms unless there 
are emergencies. Parents/guardians are therefore discouraged from 
calling for their children for unimportant matters. 
Students who are sick should stay home. Students who get sick 
in school may be asked to go home. Parents are informed to pick them 
up from school. 
Parents are requested to make sure that their children are 
promptly fetched from school after class hours.  
84   
CODE OF CONDUCT 
IJA is an advocate of Positive Discipline. Part of its Personnel 
Professional Development Program is a training for them to practice the 
balance between “warmth” and “structure” as important elements of 
Positive Discipline in Everyday Teaching. The school believes that any 
educational institution or organization can only function effectively if 
there is discipline and order among the members of its community. To 
attain this, students are expected to behave in a manner that shows 
respect and consideration for others, as well as to display the ability to 
follow rules and regulations set by the school, as agreed upon by all its 
stakeholders.  
School officials and academic personnel have the right to 
impose appropriate and reasonable interventions in cases of minor 
misbehaviors or breach of good discipline committed in their presence. 
However, no cruel or physically harmful punishments shall be imposed or 
applied against any student (Manual of Regulations for Private Schools, 
2010). 
Some Expected Behaviors 
Attendance and Punctuality  
1. Students are expected to arrive on time for the morning 
assembly.  
2. Students are expected to say the prayers reverently and 
participate in the flag ceremony. 
Responsibility and Discipline 
1. After the assembly, students are expected to proceed to their 
classroom in silence and in single file. 
2. Silence should be maintained in the corridors and stairs at all 
times. When passing along the corridors and using the stairs, the 
students should always stay on the right side. 
3. Prayers before and after classes should be said in reverence. 
4. Unnecessary talking, giggling and other ways of distracting or 
disturbing the class should be avoided. 
5. A permanent seat is assigned to the student for each quarter of 
  85 
the year. Unless otherwise instructed, the student should stay in 
the seat assigned to him/her. 
6. The student should bring all the required books/materials to the 
class. Borrowing these materials is discouraged. 
7. The student is expected to be in the assigned classroom during 
class hours, unless given permission to be elsewhere. Students 
who are not in the classroom and who are not given permission 
to leave may incur a class cut. 
8. Students who get sick and who need to go to the clinic should 
get a clinic slip from the class secretary. The clinic slip, together 
with the admit-to-class slip, should be returned to the class 
secretary with the signature of the nurse. 
9. Students are discouraged from leaving the classroom during 
class hours. If a student has official business to attend to, he/she 
must secure an admit-to-class slip before returning to his/her 
classroom. The CR pass is necessary when a student needs to 
go to the bathroom. 
10. Students (Grade 4 to Grade 12) are not allowed to eat inside 
the classroom. 
11. Students are expected to maintain order and discipline (i.e., 
avoiding very loud conversations, rough horseplay, unnecessary 
running, pushing, shoving and similar behavior) in the library, 
canteen, and other learning areas within the campus. 
12. The class is responsible for keeping the classroom attractive, 
neat, clean and orderly. 
13. Students are responsible for the chairs assigned to them in the 
beginning of the year. They should be kept free from writings, 
etchings, or damage. 
14. Students are expected to come in neat and complete uniform. 
Failure to comply with this is a minor misbehavior. 
Integrity and Honesty  
Honesty and integrity are the two most important values the 
school wishes to cultivate in the students. Thus, cheating shows a major 
defiance of these values and any student found to be doing such 
86   
behavior is given more intensive intervention. The following are examples 
of cheating: possession and/or use of codigo or crib notes, copying or 
looking at another’s paper, allowing another to copy from one’s paper, 
giving signals during tests which may be construed as asking for answers, 
plagiarism and other acts analogous to the above. 
Other actions/behaviors before, during and after examinations 
may be interpreted as cheating, and are therefore, not allowed: getting 
and/or giving a copy of the test, giving and/or receiving vital 
information about the test, looking around even without copying, talking 
without the proctor’s permission, and talking while the test papers are 
being passed or collected. 
As a rule, students should take care of their things, money and 
other valuables so they do not get lost. In the same manner, students 
are also expected to show honesty with things that do not belong to 
them. Any student who is found to have been taking or in possession of 
items that are not his/her own will be dealt with intense intervention. 
Courtesy and Respect 
Students are expected to show courtesy and respect to fellow 
students, teachers and other school authorities. Disrespectful behaviors 
towards teachers and school authorities, insubordination or instigating 
others to insubordination are considered serious misbehaviors. 
Moreover, respect and understanding for others should be a 
rule of one’s deportment. Disagreements or conflicts among students 
can always be resolved peacefully and reasonably. Physical assault, 
fighting, injuring fellow student or instigating a fight shows disregard for 
the other. Name calling, teasing, and the like are affronts to one’s 
person and may lead to fights and other misunderstanding.  
Writing on the walls, defacing school property such as bulletin 
boards, damaging school facilities and the like are acts of vandalism 
that are considered serious misbehaviors. They show lack of courtesy 
and respect for the property of others. Any vandalism committed inside 
the school premises should be reported to the class adviser.

NOTE: 
A student who obtains more than 2 NIs will be subject for deliberation 
any time. A warning will be done on the second NI entry to prevent a 
third NI. He/she may either be:  
(a) readmitted for the following academic year but will be placed 
on Conduct Probation*** or 
(b) not readmitted for the following academic year or 
(c) immediately dropped from the roll 
***Under Conduct Probation (He/she should obtain at least a 
Satisfactory (S) grade in his/her conduct the following 
academic year. Failure to meet this requirement may mean 
that the student will not be readmitted for the next academic 
year. 
Disciplinary Interventions 
Interventions in IJA are approaches to correct or modify a 
student’s misbehavior and are also reminders for the students to refrain 
from disobeying rules and regulations of the school. In lieu of sanctions, 
the school may allow students to choose to engage in voluntary 
productive activities, to make restitution for wrong-doings. These students 
may be allowed to help maintain the cleanliness inside the campus, 
assist in the offices or library, or assist during programs and activities, etc. 
1. Misbehavior Report 
A student who commits a minor misbehavior may be called by 
a teacher for counseling and/or may be issued a misbehavior 
report sent to the parents. 
2. Restorative Justice 
A student who has been found to have committed a serious 
misbehavior will be guided to channel his acts toward a more 
positive behavior. This will be done by asking him/her to do some 
meaningful tasks related to the misbehavior in the hope that he/she  
realizes the consequences of a negative action and eventually 
learns to be heedful of his future actions and decisions. This is upon 
the recommendation of the PDC and approval of the Principal.  
When this type of intervention needs to be done, parents will be 
  93 
notified through a notice of decision, which shall be given by the 
APSD or the Cluster Leader concerned, after investigations and 
deliberations have been done. 
3. Community Service 
A student who has been found to be committing serious 
misbehaviors, despite reminders and behavior modification, may be 
required to render community service of varying forms as a means 
of corrective action for infractions of school rules. 
4. Exclusion 
When all positive means of corrections and behavior 
modification have been exhausted but seem to be not effective in 
helping a misbehaving student, the school will be constrained to 
recommend that the child be transferred to a new environment 
where he/she may be better helped. In this case, the student will be 
issued his/her transfer credentials upon accomplishment of 
clearance. 
Exclusion from Graduation Ceremonies 
Students sometimes commit serious misbehaviors fairly close to 
graduation. When the school wants to send a message of disapproval, 
without interfering with the student’s post-graduation plans, it may 
exclude the student from graduation ceremonies. (Education Law and 
the Private Schools 2009 Revised Expanded Edition p. 508) 
5. Expulsion 
Being an advocate of positive discipline, Infant Jesus Academy 
makes every effort to help a misbehaving student change his/her 
behavior positively. However, it refuses to tolerate behaviors that 
may put others in danger or may be detrimental to the good order 
of the school. Students exhibiting such behaviors will be removed 
from the school system and will also be excluded from admission to 
any private or public school in the Philippines. This action will require 
the approval of the Secretary of the Department of Education. 
(Manual of Regulations for Private Schools, D.O. No. 88 s. 2010).  
The Positive Discipline Committee (PDC) 
The PDC shall deliberate and resolve all reported cases of 
94   
students committing serious and/or very serious misbehaviors. The 
Committee will be composed of the following: 
1. Assistant Principal for Student Development 
2. Guidance Coordinator 
3. concerned Cluster Leader 
4. concerned Class Adviser 
5. concerned teacher/personnel 
Resolution of Reported Cases of Serious or Very Serious Misbehaviors 
Committed by Students 
A major misbehavior or accumulated minor misbehaviors is 
handled by the Assistant Principal for Student Development (ASPD), 
ensuring and safeguarding the rights of all parties to due process. 
1. The APSD conducts a preliminary investigation of a serious or 
very serious misbehavior formally reported to his/her office 
through an incident report. 
2. If the results of the preliminary investigation show that a 
misbehavior may have been committed, the APSD instructs the 
class adviser to inform all parties, including the parents of the 
student involved, of the misbehavior possibly committed. The 
student(s) involved will be given 48 hours upon receipt of the 
notice of possible misbehavior to prepare an explanation which 
will be heard during a formal investigation.  
3. If merited, the APSD conducts a formal investigation where 
evidences or witnesses may be presented by the offended and 
the offending parties. 
4. The APSD prepares a report and immediately calls the Positive 
Discipline Committee (PDC) to review the case. 
5. The PDC reviews all the facts of the case. Further investigation or 
a re-investigation is conducted when needed.  
6. The PDC forwards (for review and approval) to the Principal its 
findings and recommendations for appropriate interventions. 
7. The ASPD formally informs, thru the Notice of Decision, all parties 
concerned including the parents regarding the decision.  
  95 
8. The appropriate interventions are implemented.  
In cases of misbehaviors where exclusion or expulsion may 
possibly be recommended, the Child Protection Council (CPC) will 
be convened to deliberate on the case. The procedures for this 
deliberation are stipulated in the Child Protection Policy of the 
school. The IJA Child Protection Council is composed of the 
following: 
Chairman: Principal 
Vice Chairman: APSD or any other designated school official 
Members:  Concerned Cluster Leader 
Class Adviser 
Parent Representative designated by the IJAFC 
Student Representative designated by the Student 
Coordinating Body 
The decision of the PDC or CPC may be appealed by the 
parents of the student involved to the Campus Coordinator for 
reconsideration. 
FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS 
Schedule of School Fees 
1. Annual – all school fees are paid upon enrollment of the 
student. 
2. Semestral – Payment of fees are made in two installments: a) 
upon enrollment in June; and b) the first week of October. 
3. Quarterly – Payment of fees made in four installments: a) upon 
enrollment in June; b) first week of August; c) first week of 
October; and d) first week of December. 
4. Monthly – Payment of fees are made in monthly installments – 
due on the first week of the due month. 
Financial Policies 
1. All financial transactions should be made at the Business Office. 
Students and parents are advised to ask for a receipt for all 
96   
payments made. These receipts should be filed, and presented 
when required.  
2. The Business Office accepts cash, dated check payments 
payable to the School’s Account only and through BPI Family 
Bank. Those paying through checks need to sign the Business 
Office Form pertaining to Check Payments. For payment thru 
BPI, the account name and number are available at the 
Business office.  
3. Fines are imposed on students who enroll late. Likewise, fees are 
imposed on late payment of tuition fees. 
4. The Business Office may not issue notices of accounts to the 
students. The schedule of payment of fees is given out in the 
beginning of the school year. Parents are responsible for 
ensuring that fees are paid on time. 
5. The admission card serves as an examination permit. The 
student must settle all accounts due up to the month during 
which the examination is given, before the admission card is 
released. 
6. The Business Office may withhold the report card and other 
documents of students who have not settled their financial 
obligations. 
7. Students who submit a promissory note should do so at least 3 
days before the examinations. Only the signature of the parents 
will be considered valid. 
Data Privacy Notice: 
IJA adheres to the Data Privacy Act of 2012 and is committed to ensuring 
the privacy, security, and confidentiality of student data (such as name 
and address, parents’ information, and other data necessary for identifying 
students) while enabling the information to be used to improve student 
academic outcomes. It shares these data only with people authorized to 
see them such as the class adviser, the parents and/or recognized

DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION 
Policy and Guidelines on Protecting Children in School from 
Abuse, Violence, Exploitation, Discrimination, Bullying and Other 
Forms of Abuse 
I. GENERAL PROVSIONS  
Section 1. Short Title 
This Department Order shall be known as the "DepEd Child Protection 
Policy." 
Section 2. - Statement of Policy 
Pursuant  to   the  1987   Constitution,  the State shall   defend the right of 
children  to assistance, including proper care and nutrition, and special protec
tion from all forms of neglect, abuse, cruelty, exploitation and other  conditions 
prejudicial to their development (Article XV, Section 3 [2]). 
The Constitution further provides that all educational institutions shall incul
cate patriotism  and  nationalism,  foster    love of  humanity,  respect   for  hu
man  rights, appreciation of the role of national heroes in the historical develop
ment of the country, teach the rights and duties of citizenship, strengthen ethical 
and spiritual values, develop moral character and personal discipline, encour
age critical and creative thinking, broaden scientific and technological 
knowledge, and promote vocational efficiency. (Article XIV, Section 3 [2]). 
The Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) aims to protect children 
from all   forms  of  physical  or  mental  violence, injury   and abuse, neglect or  
negligent treatment, maltreatment and exploitation, including sexual abuse. The  
same  Convention  establishes  the right of the child to education, and with a 
view to achieving this right progressively, and on the basis of equal opportunity, 
it obliges the government to take measures to encourage regular attendance in 
school and reduce drop-out rates. Thus, it is mandated that all appropriate 
measures be undertaken to ensure that school discipline  is  administered  in  a  
manner  consistent   with  the  child's  human  dignity,  and  in conformity with 
the CRC. 
Towards  this  end, the  Department  of   Education (DepEd), in collabora
tion with its partners and stakeholders, shall ensure that all schools are condu
cive to the education  of children. The  best  interest  of  the  child  shall   be   
the  paramount  consideration in all  decisions  and  actions  involving children, 
whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, 
administrative authorities, and legislative bodies, consistent with the principle of 
First Call for Children, as enunciated in the CRC. Teachers and learning facilita
tors especially in learning centers are their substitute parents, and are expected 
to discharge their functions and duties with this in mind. In this connection, the 
Family Code empowers the school, its administrators and teachers, or the indi
vidual, entity or institution engaged in child  care  to  exercise the  special  pa
rental  authority  and  responsibility  over the  child,  while under their supervi
sion, instruction or custody. 
The Department recognizes that cases of abuse may arise as a result of 
the difficult situations faced by teachers and other officials within and outside 
school. 
DepEd has adopted the  policy to provide  special protection to children 
who are gravely threatened or endangered by circumstances which affect their 
normal development  and  over which they have no control, and to assist the 
concerned agencies in their rehabilitation. 
  101 
Furthermore,  this  Department  aims to  ensure  such   special protection 
from all   forms  of  abuse   and  exploitation  and  care  as is necessary for the 
child's well-being,  taking  into account the primary rights and duties of parents, 
legal guardians, or other individuals who are legally responsible and exercise 
custody over the child. DepEd  recognizes the participatory rights of the child in 
the formulation and implementation of policies, and in all proceedings affecting 
them, whether they be victims or aggressors, either directly, or through a repre
sentative. Accordingly, this  Department  reiterates  a zero  tolerance  policy  for 
any  act  of child abuse, exploitation, violence, discrimination, bullying and other 
forms of abuse, and hereby promulgates this Department Order. 
Section 3. - Definition of Terms

property;

g. Demanding or requiring sexual or monetary favors, or exacting money or 
property, from a pupil or student; and 
h. Restraining the liberty and freedom of a pupil or student. 
2. Cyber-bullying - is  any  conduct  defined  in  the preceding  paragraph, as 
resulting in harassment,  intimidation,  or  humiliation,   through   electronic  
means  or   other     technology, such  as, but  not limited  to texting, email,  
instant  messaging, chatting, internet, social networking websites or other 
platforms or   formats. 
"Other acts of abuse by a pupil, student or learner"- refers to other serious acts 
of abuse committed by a pupil, student or learner upon  another pupil, student

suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried.  He 
descended to the dead. On the third day He rose again. He ascend
ed into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father.  He will

HYMNS 
Lupang Hinirang 
(Philippine National Anthem) 
Bayang magiliw  
Perlas ng silanganan  
Alab ng puso  
Sa dibdib mo'y buhay  
Lupang Hinirang  
Duyan ka nang magiting  
Sa manlulupig  
Di ka pasisiil  
Sa dagat at bundok sa simoy  
At sa langit mong bughaw  
May dilag ang tula  
At awit sa paglayang minamahal  
Ang kislap ng watawat mo'y  
tagumpay na nagniningning  
Ang bituin at araw niyang  
kailanpama'y di magdidilim  
Lupa ng araw ng luwalhati't pagsinta  
Buhay ay langit sa piling mo  
Aming ligaya nang pag  
May mang-aapi  
Ang mamatay ng dahil sayo  
  111 
Marikina Hymn 
Marikina aking hirang 
Bayang naming minamahal 
Sa’yong puso ay may buhay 
Ang paglaya’t angking dangal. 
Marikina, ika’y dakila 
Hiyas na tangi nitong bansa 
Marikina, idadambana 
Ang giting mo’y di mawawala. 
Infant Jesus Academy Hymn 
Reign high above 
The clouds and take our voice 
Through countrywide. 
Soar Spirit above 
Throughout the mountainside. 
Reign high and let bended knees 
Spread out across the seas 
Lift Thy gracious hands 
You’re the hope of our land. 
Yes, Infant Jesus is the light of all 
And His mission will rule 
For your sons and daughters 
With your spirit like that blue above 
Shining, floating, whispering 
Your love for us 
Will carry on the might 
Lyrics: Mr. Antonio Mortel 
Music: Ms. Carmela Salazar
